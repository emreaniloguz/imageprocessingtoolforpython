# Basic Image Processing Application for Python / Computer Vision Applications


We have developed a user interface that has capability of apply different type of image processing functions with easily. With a well-designed user interface, different techniques can be applied!



##  Used  Libraries ##

- PySide2 
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Numpy


For now its just support masking operations, but in the next couple of months, different image processing techniques will be added
