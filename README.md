# Basic Image Processing Application for Python / Computer Vision Applications


We have developed a user interface that has capability of apply different type of image processing functions with easily. With a well-designed user interface, different type of processes can be executed.


##  Used  Libraries ##

- PySide2 5.12.2
- Matplotlib 3.4.2
- OpenCV 4.5.2.52
- Numpy 1.18.0


For now its just support masking operations, but in the next couple of months, different image processing techniques will be added
